# Changelog

## Unreleased

Background serving, instance tracking, and config hot reload: `awerouter serve run <profile> -d` runs the daemon detached (survives the terminal, logs to `<state>/serve-<profile>.log`), `awerouter serve status` lists every running serve instance — foreground and background — and `awerouter serve stop [PROFILE]` stops them gracefully. Serve now also watches `routing.json`/`providers.json` and applies edits without a restart.

### Added
- `serve` is now a command group — `run` (start a daemon), `status`, `stop` — instead of a bare command with top-level `status`/`stop`. The pre-group spellings keep working: `awerouter serve <profile> [--port/--host/-d]` and `awerouter <profile>` are equivalent to `awerouter serve run <profile>` (an unknown subcommand under `serve` is a profile name, same as the top level), and bare `awerouter serve` still auto-selects the single profile. The one removal: `awerouter serve -d` (background auto-select, no profile) — name the profile or use `serve run`.
- `awerouter serve run [PROFILE] -d/--background`: spawns the daemon detached via `python -m awerouter __serve_daemon__ <profile>` (new `__main__.py`), waits for it to bind, then prints pid/port/log path plus a `status`/`stop` hint; notes when the profile is already running (starts another anyway, same as concurrent foreground instances). A child that dies before binding fails the command with the log tail. POSIX-only (`os.name == "nt"` refuses).
- `awerouter serve status` / `awerouter serve stop [PROFILE]` (new `awerouter.runtime` module): every serve process registers `{pid, profile, protocol, port, host, background, started}` under `<state>/run/<pid>.json` at bind time and unregisters on shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGHUP now shut down gracefully via signal handlers on the serve event loop). `serve status` lists live instances (stale/dead-pid files pruned on sight); `serve stop` SIGTERMs matching instances after a command-line guard (`ps` token match: `awerouter`, `-m awerouter`, `.../bin/awerouter`) so a reused pid is never signaled. Windows: `pid_alive` probes via `OpenProcess` (os.kill(pid, 0) would TerminateProcess there), and `-d`/`serve stop` refuse outright.
- Hot reload: `_serve` polls both config files' mtimes (1s) and swaps the live app's `profile`/`settings`/`providers` from a fresh `load_for_profile` — destinations, thresholds, tool routing, per-profile overrides, provider entries, and `"auto"` threshold re-resolution all apply to the next request without a restart. A file that fails to load prints one `config reload skipped` line and the previous config keeps serving until the file parses again; a changed `port` field prints a restart hint (rebinding is out of scope). The serve banner prints `hot reload -> on`.
- Skill refresh nudge: `awerouter self-update` (after a successful upgrade) and the daily update reminder now add one line when the awerouter agent skill is detected in `~/.agents/skills/` or `~/.claude/skills/` — the skill is updated along with awerouter releases, and refreshing it is best done by the coding agent itself: `aweskill update awerouter`. awerouter never writes the skill file: its lifecycle (store, projections, local-edit protection) belongs to aweskill, and the skill is not packaged in the wheel, so awerouter only points at the refresh command.

## v0.5.4

Image bridge: `settings.imageBridge` (default `false`, opt-in) gives a text-only pro model second-hand vision. When a request carries images only in history — the final message is text — awerouter has the multimodal flash destination (`imageModel`) transcribe each distinct image, replaces the image blocks with the transcription text before routing, and the session falls through to `defaultModel` (pro) instead of being pinned to flash forever. A fresh upload this turn still routes to flash natively; `router.py` is unchanged — after the rewrite `has_image` is false and the request lands in L3/default, before the rewrite the L1 image guard routes it as always. The `step-glm-mm` template now ships with `imageBridge: true`.

### Added
- `settings.imageBridge` (`true`/`false`, global or per profile, validated at load and shown by `config show`): the request-pipeline transform described above. It runs before rtk compression and routing in `_proxy_flow`, so what rtk compresses, what L3 scores, and what goes upstream are exactly the same body; `handle_count_tokens` applies the same bridge so the client's context-window estimate matches. The serve banner prints `image bridge -> on (...)` naming the transcribing destination.
- `awerouter.vision` (pure logic): per-protocol content keys (`image_key`), caption body building and response parsing for all three wire protocols, in-place image-block rewriting (`[Image n, transcribed by <model>]` text blocks), and a content-addressed caption cache (bounded FIFO, process lifetime — a restart re-transcribes each distinct image once; the cache key includes provider+model, so a destination switch never serves another model's transcription).
- Failure fallback: any caption call failure (network, non-200, empty text) leaves the request body untouched — one printed line, and the L1 image guard routes the request exactly as before. Codex subscription logins (`auth: "codex"`, SSE-only backend) skip the bridge entirely.
- `step-glm-mm` template sets `imageBridge: true`; `init --merge` flags a newly-written `imageBridge` as a behavior shift next to `imageModel`/`defaultModel`. README/README_cn document it as an "Image bridge" (图片桥接) section; README.ai.md and the awerouter skill mention the template flag.

### Behavior notes
- Bridged "vision" is second-hand: its ceiling is the transcription quality, and each distinct image costs one extra flash call (cached per image content for the process lifetime).
- The flash→pro rescue fallback (flash down on an un-rewritten image request) still carries raw images to a possibly text-only pro — pre-existing behavior, unchanged and out of scope.

## v0.5.3

Per-profile settings overrides and template merging: every `settings` key (`backgroundModel`, `thinkModel`, `webSearchModel`, `imageModel`, `defaultModel`, `searchResultDiscount`, `toolRouting`, `longContextAuto`) can now be written directly in a profile body, flat next to `protocol`/`destinations` — it applies to that profile alone, and missing keys (missing fields inside `toolRouting`/`longContextAuto` included) inherit from the global `settings` block, so a profile re-tunes exactly what differs. `backgroundModel`/`thinkModel` in a profile body are the pre-v0.5.2 per-profile shape, honored again. Serve and the router use the merged result (`RoutingProfile.settings`); a profile's own `longContextAuto.fallbackThreshold` now backs its `"auto"` threshold; `usage calibrate`/token views with `--profile` use that profile's discount. `config show <profile>` prints the effective values with the override keys flat in the entry, the serve banner lists them on an `overrides -> ...` line. Unknown keys die at load naming the offender — profile bodies now validate their key set too (previously silently ignored), and the global block gets the same check, so a typo'd key never silently inherits.

`awerouter init <template> --merge` folds a bundled template into an existing config: missing provider entries, profiles, and settings keys are filled in; existing entries always win (your `base_url`/`auth`, your profile bodies, your explicitly-set settings). Profile id collisions are skipped and reported, so merging is idempotent. Newly-written `imageModel`/`defaultModel` — global keys that re-route every existing profile — print a warning with an `awerouter restore` hint. Both files are snapshotted to `.bak` before writing and the merged config is load-validated before `init` reports done.

### Added
- Per-profile settings overrides: every `settings` key may also be written directly in a profile body, flat next to `protocol`/`destinations` — it applies to that profile alone, and missing keys (missing fields inside `toolRouting`/`longContextAuto` included) inherit from the global `settings` block, so a profile re-tunes exactly what differs (e.g. one multimodal sidekick flipping `imageModel`/`defaultModel` without touching everyone else). `backgroundModel`/`thinkModel` in a profile body are the pre-v0.5.2 per-profile shape, honored again. Serve and the router use the merged result (`RoutingProfile.settings`); a profile's own `longContextAuto.fallbackThreshold` now backs its `"auto"` threshold; `usage calibrate`/token views with `--profile` use that profile's discount. `config show <profile>` prints the effective values with the override keys flat in the entry, the serve banner lists them on an `overrides -> ...` line. Unknown keys die at load naming the offender — profile bodies now validate their key set too (previously silently ignored), and the global block gets the same check, so a typo'd key never silently inherits.
- `awerouter init <template> --merge` folds a bundled template into an existing config: missing provider entries, profiles, and settings keys are filled in; existing entries always win (your `base_url`/`auth`, your profile bodies, your explicitly-set settings). Profile id collisions are skipped and reported, so merging is idempotent. Newly-written `imageModel`/`defaultModel` — global keys that re-route every existing profile — print a warning with an `awerouter restore` hint. Both files are snapshotted to `.bak` before writing and the merged config is load-validated before `init` reports done.

## v0.5.2

Multimodal sidekicks and multi-protocol profiles: image routing and the fall-through default become settings, enabling a pro-first profile where a non-multimodal flagship (GLM 5.3) does all the work and a multimodal flash (StepFun step-3.7-flash) takes only image-bearing requests — the new `step-glm-mm` template. A profile's `protocol` now also accepts a list, so one serve instance can speak several wire protocols on a single port.

### Added
- Multi-protocol profiles: `protocol` accepts an id or a non-empty list (`["anthropic", "openai-chat"]`). One serve instance registers every protocol's endpoints and serves each listed one; clients pick by endpoint path (`/v1/messages` vs `/v1/chat/completions` vs `/v1/responses`). Every destination provider must exist in each served providers.json group (per-protocol `base_url`s) — a name missing from one group dies at load naming the group. The serve banner shows `protocol -> anthropic+openai-chat` and prints one client-hint block per protocol; `awerouter list` shows the joined form; `config show` mirrors the config shape (id vs list); the request log's `protocol` field records the endpoint that actually served the request.
- `settings.imageModel` (default `pro`) and `settings.defaultModel` (default `flash`) in routing.json. `imageModel` re-aims the image guard; `defaultModel` flips the cost-first fall-through (`pro` = everything text goes to the flagship). Both validated to `flash`/`pro` at load, shown by `config show`, and printed on the serve banner when they deviate from defaults (`image -> ... default -> ...`, and `main -> pro` instead of `main -> auto`).
- Bundled template `step-glm-mm` (`awerouter init step-glm-mm`): flash = StepFun step_plan `step-3.7-flash`, pro = GLM coding plan `glm-5.3`, with `imageModel: flash` + `defaultModel: pro` — the "solve multimodal, skip smart routing" preset. Dual-protocol: both vendors ship in the `anthropic` group too (stepfun `step_plan`, glm `open.bigmodel.cn/api/anthropic`), so one instance serves Claude Code (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` without `/v1`) and openai-chat agents (`OPENAI_BASE_URL` with `/v1`) on the same port. README/README_cn document it under "Common setup templates" with the swap-flash-to-`glm-5.3-flash` variant; README.ai.md lists it.

### Changed
- The image check moved from L3 to L1 (right below web_search, above tier labels and long context): image routing is a capability decision, not a difficulty guess — with `imageModel: flash` an image-bearing request must reach the multimodal model no matter what tier label it carries or how long it is.
- `load_for_profile` and `create_app` now carry providers grouped by served protocol (`{protocol: {name: Provider}}`); `RoutingProfile.protocol` (string) became `RoutingProfile.protocols` (tuple) with a `protocol` display property — single-protocol configs and profiles are unaffected.

### Behavior notes
- At default settings the only routing change is label placement: a request with an image now labels `image` even when it also crossed `longContextThreshold` or carried a tier label. Destination-wise, a background-tier request containing an image now routes pro (was flash) — vision content is hard, and the "any image goes to imageModel, period" invariant is the one worth keeping.
- The `awerouter add` wizard still writes a single protocol; multi-protocol profiles are a hand edit (documented in README).

## v0.5.1 - 2026-08-28

Two additions on top of v0.5.0's codex story: Claude Pro/Max subscription logins become routing destinations on the Anthropic side, and routing setup gets bundled presets — `awerouter init step-glm` / `glm-codex` generate a matched providers + routing pair for known-good flash/pro combos in one shot.

Claude subscription accounts become routing destinations: `"auth": "claude"` in the `anthropic` group routes through a Claude Pro/Max subscription login that awerouter itself owns — no local Claude Code CLI login is needed (and none is borrowed; each OAuth login is an independent session). Mirrors the codex design where the mechanics allow it and inverts it where they don't: codex is read-only because OpenAI refresh tokens are single-use and the CLI must own refresh, while this login belongs to awerouter, so it refreshes.

### Added
- `awerouter.claude`: PKCE device login (`awerouter login claude` opens the browser, user pastes the code shown on the callback page) against the reverse-engineered public wire contract shared by every community client (client id, `platform.claude.com` authorize/token, legacy `console.anthropic.com` as a 404/405 fallback). Tokens persist in `~/.config/awerouter/claude-auth.json`, written atomically with 0600 perms. `awerouter logout claude` removes the login.
- Rotation-safe auto-refresh: access tokens are short-lived (~hours, 5-minute margin) and renewed with the rotating refresh token; a response without a new refresh token keeps the old one. An in-process lock plus a re-read under it keep concurrent requests from racing the refresh; a second awerouter process winning the race is recovered the same way (refresh rejected + file changed underneath → the winner's token is used).
- Request-path integration: per-request `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` plus the OAuth-required `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` flag (merged with any beta flags already present), `anthropic-version` defaulted when the client omitted it. No body normalization — the Messages API is the Messages API. Refresh runs off the event loop (`asyncio.to_thread`), so a renewal never blocks other in-flight requests.
- 401 handling mirrors codex: an upstream 401 forces one refresh and retries the same destination; a 401 that survives means the login is dead — flash falls back to a keyed pro (one printed line, `401-retry` marker in `usage log`) and only surfaces when pro rides the same login. A missing login is a 503 with a `run: awerouter login claude` hint plus a serve-start warning (store check only — a stale token doesn't warn, it refreshes on the first request).
- Proxy awareness extends to claude providers (`https_proxy`/`all_proxy`) — api.anthropic.com and platform.claude.com often need the shell proxy. Config guard: the `claude` sentinel dies at load in non-`anthropic` groups; `config show` renders it as `claude (subscription OAuth login)`. Default providers template ships a ready-to-use `claude` entry in the `anthropic` group.
- Bundled routing templates: `awerouter init [template]` generates a matched `providers.json` + `routing.json` pair in one shot. Templates live in `src/awerouter/resources/templates/` as `<name>.providers.json` + `<name>.routing.json` pairs (`default` is the previous built-in config); an unknown name fails with the list of available ones. Two ready-made combos ship: `step-glm` (key-only, openai-chat: flash = StepFun step_plan, pro = GLM coding plan) and `glm-codex` (openai-responses: flash = GLM coding plan, pro = ChatGPT subscription via `auth: "codex"`). README/README_cn gain a "Common setup templates" (常见搭配模版) section showing both combos as copy-paste snippets; README.ai.md and the awerouter skill document the template argument.

### Behavior notes
- ToS caveat: per Anthropic's 2026 policy, third-party use of subscription OAuth tokens is restricted — this rides the user's own subscription, at their own risk, and the wire contract can drift without notice (one-constant fixes in `awerouter/claude.py`).

## v0.5.0 - 2026-08-28

Codex subscription accounts become routing destinations: `"auth": "codex"` in the `openai-responses` group rides the local Codex CLI login (`$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`) instead of an API key, so the subscription's own models mix into flash/pro routing next to key-based providers — cheap traffic to StepFun/GLM/deepseek keys, hard traffic to the Codex account. Any Responses-speaking agent points at awerouter with a dummy key and reaches the Codex backend through the same transparent proxy as everything else (wire contract verified against the live backend, mirroring awewarm's native transport: Bearer access_token + chatgpt-account-id + OpenAI-Beta/originator headers).

### Added
- `awerouter.codex`: `AUTH_SENTINEL` ("codex"), `load_codex_login()` (accepts both the `{"tokens": {...}}` shell and a flat block), `apply_codex_auth()` writing the full header set. `_set_auth` dispatches on the sentinel; requests carry a fresh read of `auth.json` every time.
- 401 handling: the login file may change under a running serve (the CLI refreshes it) — an upstream 401 re-reads `auth.json` and retries the same destination once. A 401 that survives the re-read means the login itself is rejected: flash requests then take the flash→pro fallback (one printed line per fallback) when pro carries its own key, and surface the 401 only when pro rides the same codex login. A missing/invalid login file is a 503 with a `run: codex login` hint and no fallback — a missing login is a config error best surfaced immediately, not silently served from a paid pro; serve also prints a startup warning when `auth.json` doesn't exist yet. The 401 re-read is recorded in the request log (`codex_retried`), shown by `usage log` as a `401-retry` marker, so CLI token churn is visible in calibration data instead of hiding inside a 200's latency.
- Body normalization for codex providers: `store` is forced to `false` (the ChatGPT Codex backend is zero-data-retention and rejects `store: true`) and `max_output_tokens` is dropped (sampling controls are CLI-internal; clients that send them get 400s). The backend's SSE-only nature is bridged — a non-streaming request goes upstream as a stream and returns buffered into a single JSON response object, with output items rebuilt from `response.output_item.done` events (the terminal object omits them). Everything else passes through untouched as always.
- Proxy awareness, codex providers only: `_codex_proxy()` resolves `https_proxy`/`all_proxy` (plus macOS system settings via `getproxies()`) — chatgpt.com commonly needs the shell proxy. Loopback base_urls never take the proxy; socks-only setups are ignored (would need aiohttp-socks); every other provider keeps its direct connection, byte-identical behavior.
- Config guard: the `codex` sentinel dies at load in non-`openai-responses` groups (the backend speaks Responses only); `config show` renders it as `codex (local CLI login)`. Default providers template ships a ready-to-use `codex` entry in the `openai-responses` group.

### Behavior notes
- No token refresh, ever, by design: OpenAI refresh tokens are single-use and rotating — server-side refresh would invalidate the local CLI's login. The CLI keeps sole ownership of refresh; awerouter re-reads the file per request (and once more on 401). Access tokens live ~10 days; normal `codex` usage (or awewarm warm-ups) keeps the login fresh.
- Codex model names drift (`gpt-5-codex`/`gpt-5.1-codex` already 400); the destination's `model` field is the single place to update.
- Existing providers are untouched: static keys, no-auth locals, and the retry/fallback ladder behave exactly as before.

## v0.4.9 - 2026-08-24

Local models become first-class routing destinations: `auth` is now optional in providers.json, so local inference servers (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM) take their place next to API-key providers under the same protocol groups — and since flash→pro fallback already fires on connection errors, a flash=local / pro=cloud profile gives you local-first routing with a transparent cloud safety net. Ollama ≥ 0.14 speaks the Anthropic protocol natively, so even Claude Code profiles can put a local model on flash.

### Added
- Local (no-auth) providers: `auth` may be omitted, `null`, or `""` in providers.json — requests go upstream with no auth header at all (the client's incoming key is dropped, not forwarded). `Provider.auth` is `Optional`; `config show` renders no-auth as `null`; `awerouter add` accepts an empty auth env var (the "two filling modes" live in the wizard, not in a second config file — protocol remains the only grouping axis). Default providers template ships ready-to-use `ollama` examples for the `anthropic` (`http://127.0.0.1:11434`) and `openai-chat` (`http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`) groups.
- Forgotten-key guard, layered: a provider with no `auth` whose `base_url` is not loopback prints a serve-start warning (`_noauth_warning`); the `add` wizard asks for confirmation in the same case before writing. Informational, not fatal — LAN no-auth servers (vLLM on 192.168.x) are legitimate. Loopback detection (`is_loopback_url`) parses the host as an IP via `ipaddress` (whole 127/8 plus `::1`) rather than prefix-matching, so `127.0.0.1.evil.com` does not count as local.
- README/README_cn: "Local models (no auth)" / "本地模型（免认证）" section — path conventions per protocol, a mixed flash=local / pro=cloud destination example, end-to-end Ollama deployment steps with default ports for LM Studio/llama.cpp/vLLM, and the local-down→cloud-fallback behavior. README.ai.md (Step 4/5) and resources/skills/awerouter/SKILL.md now cover no-auth local providers as well; CONTRIBUTING's config-semantics section catches up (optional `auth`, `protocol` group key, `toolRouting`/`longContextAuto` in settings, L4 in the routing diagram).

### Behavior notes
- A providers.json entry that previously died with "missing base_url or auth" now loads when only `auth` is absent — that was the point. A missing `base_url` still dies. A cloud API configured without auth now surfaces as an upstream 401 at request time (visible in `usage log`) plus the serve-start warning, instead of a load-time error.

## v0.4.8 - 2026-08-18

L4 sheds its dead weight: the search/mechanical phase rules are gone and the layer is now a single **edit checkpoint** — the turn after the trailing tool batch changed code goes to pro (flash drafts, pro reviews). Those rules defaulted to flash, which is already the fall-through, so at defaults this changes no routing outcome; what it buys is that config, docs, and the layer's name now match its behavior.

### Changed
- `router.resolve()`: L4 is one rule — `feat.last_phase == "edit"` → `toolRouting.edit` (default pro, label `toolEdit`). `toolSearch`/`toolMech` labels no longer produced; search/mechanical turns label `default`.
- `ToolRoutingConfig` keeps only `webSearch`/`edit`. A `toolRouting` block still containing `search` or `mechanical` dies at load with instructions to delete the key — silent ignore would hide a behavior change from anyone who had set them to `pro`.
- `_call_phase` (edit > search > mechanical ranking) replaced by `_call_is_edit`; `MECHANICAL_TOOLS` and the per-extractor `_rank` tables are gone. The trailing batch is "edit" when any call in it changed code; codex's shell-wrapped `apply_patch` still counts.
- Serve banner `tool -> ...` line and `config show` `toolRouting` block now show `webSearch` (effective, legacy fallback resolved) and `edit`.
- `usage calibrate` and `_L3_LABELS` keep accepting `toolSearch` so pre-0.4.8 logs still feed threshold calibration.

### Behavior notes
- At default settings routing is byte-identical (the removed rules were no-ops below L3). A config with `search: "pro"` (forcing pro on planning turns) is no longer expressible — that was converting most coding traffic to pro; if you want that, invert the profile (pro-leaning destinations or a lower threshold).
- README/README_cn routing table and the four-layer essay rewritten: L4 is a consequence checkpoint — structure cannot see the turn that decides an edit, but the review turn after it is structurally identifiable.

## v0.4.7 - 2026-08-18

RTK matures: smart-truncate keeps a skeleton of the truncated middle so the model can see what was cut and decide whether to re-read, autodetect is hardened against single-line false positives, end-to-end idempotency keeps provider cache prefixes stable across re-sends, and RTK savings are now visible in `usage` views. READMEs carry an experimental warning.

### Added
- `smart_truncate` and `read_numbered` now keep a "skeleton" of up to 60 signature/import/declaration lines from the truncated middle (ported from rtk Rust `filter.rs` smart_truncate): beyond head 120 + tail 60, structural lines survive adjacent-duplicate-free so later dedup passes are no-ops. The read-numbered marker names the gap start (`re-read with offset=N`) so the model knows how to fetch the middle.
- RTK savings surfaced in `usage` views (previously `rtk_saved` was logged but never shown): the shared header on `usage log/stats/tokens/savings` prints `rtk: saved N input tokens (x/y requests compressed)` when the window has any; `usage log` appends `rtk=+N` to entries that were compressed (`+` marks trimmed tokens, not included in `tokens=`); `usage savings` adds an rtk block noting it stacks with flash offload. Backed by `logging.rtk_totals(since, profile)`. Nothing prints when nothing was compressed.
- README and README_cn: experimental warning explaining lossy compression, heuristic detection limits, and the `X-Awerouter-Token-Saver: off` escape hatch.
- Detection hardened against single-line false positives (inspired by rtk Rust's layered guards — as a network proxy we can't offer its raw-output tee recovery, so detection must be stricter): long-form git-status and build-output now require TWO feature lines in the detect window, closing the class where a file dump with one stray `ERROR:` / `Finished x` / `On branch` line was summarized to near-zero.

### Fixed
- Compression is now idempotent end to end (tool results are resent every turn; any byte drift between passes would break provider cache prefixes). Fixed three drifts: grep output dropped a trailing blank line on re-detection; git-diff's 500-line cap let compacted diffs re-enter the smart-truncate fallback (cap now 240, below the 250-line gate, and the fallback skips text already carrying our compression markers); tree's truncation marker itself exceeded `TREE_MAX_LINES` so resent trees lost one more line per pass.
- `_COMPRESSED_MARKERS` guard: text already carrying compression markers is left alone by the smart-truncate fallback.
- README fail-open note clarified: guards against crashes, not heuristic misjudgment (see the warning above).

### Changed
- Removed stale TODO doc (`docs/todo/rtk.md`).

## v0.4.6 - 2026-08-18

RTK compression fixes from real-traffic verification: read dumps were never compressed, and one detection bug actively corrupted Claude Code reads.

### Fixed
- `autodetect.py` read-numbered gate counted lines inside the 1024-char detection window (max a few dozen), so the `>= 250` threshold never held and every file-read dump fell through to dedup-log with zero savings. The gate now counts full-text lines.
- `READ_NUMBERED_LINE_RE` only matched Cursor's `N|content`. It now also matches opencode's `N: content` (`read.ts` emits `${n}: ${line}`; the `: ` variant requires the space so clock times don't match) and Claude Code's `N→content`.
- `_RE_PORCELAIN` matched any line with 3+ leading spaces as git-status porcelain, so Claude Code read dumps (right-padded line numbers) were rewritten to a single "clean — nothing to commit" line. Real porcelain never has both XY slots blank (git omits unmodified entries); a lookahead now rejects that case.
- Long unique-line blobs (codex reads files via shell `cat`/`sed`, no line numbers) hit dedup-log, saved nothing, and smart-truncate was unreachable behind it. `_compress_text` now falls back to smart-truncate when dedup-log yields no shrink and the text is ≥ 250 lines.

## v0.4.5 - 2026-08-18

L4 matures: parallel batches get deterministic precedence, codex's shell-wrapped calls are classified, todo/task turns join the flash side, and every tool-keyed rule (L1 webSearch included) now lives in one `settings.toolRouting` block.

### Added
- Trailing-batch semantics: the L4 signal is now the trailing parallel batch of tool calls (`InspectResult.last_tools`) taking its strongest phase (`last_phase`, edit > search > mechanical) — `[Grep, Edit]` and `[Edit, Grep]` route identically.
- Shell sniffing feeds L4: a trailing `exec_command`/`shell` call is classified by its command text — search binaries count as search, `apply_patch` counts as edit (closes the codex blind spot; shared `_pipeline_heads` parser).
- New `mechanical` phase: todo/subagent bookkeeping tools (`todo`/`todos`/`todowrite`/`todo_write`/`task`) route to `toolRouting.mechanical` (default flash, label `toolMech`).
- `settings.toolRouting` absorbs L1: `webSearch` key joins `search`/`edit`/`mechanical` in one block; the legacy top-level `webSearchModel` still works as a fallback (`toolRouting.webSearch` wins). `webSearchModel` values are now validated at load time. Serve banner prints the full mapping on one `tool -> ...` line.
- Tests: batch precedence both orders, later-batch replacement, responses run semantics, shell-wrapped search/edit classification, mechanical rule, webSearch merge/fallback/validation.

## v0.4.3 - 2026-08-18

Optional per-profile RTK tool-result compression: profiles with `"rtk": true` rewrite verbose tool output (git diff/status/log, grep hits, listings, build logs) in place before routing, cutting the request tokens coding-agent sessions resubmit every turn. Off by default — routing stays fully transparent unless you opt in.

### Added
- `src/awerouter/rtk/`: Python port of the RTK compression pipeline (via 9router's JS port of rtk-ai/rtk) — `autodetect.py` (12-format priority chain, 1024-char detect window), `filters.py` (git-diff, git-status, git-log, build-output, grep, find, tree, ls, search-list, read-numbered, dedup-log, smart-truncate), `apply.py` (safe_apply fail-open wrapper), `constants.py` (upstream thresholds), and `compress_body(body, protocol)` traversal for all three wire protocols (anthropic `tool_result` blocks, openai-chat `role:"tool"` messages, openai-responses `function_call_output` items).
- `"rtk": true` profile flag in routing.json (default off; non-bool dies at load; `config show` prints it only when set).
- Compression hook in `_proxy_flow` and `handle_count_tokens`, before routing-signal extraction: L3 decisions, `effective_tokens`, and usage logs reflect the compressed request that is actually billed. `/v1/messages/count_tokens` is compressed too, so client context estimates match reality.
- Per-request opt-out header `X-Awerouter-Token-Saver: off`; serve banner prints `rtk -> on` with the header hint when enabled.
- `RequestLog.rtk_saved`: estimated input tokens saved per request (0 = off/none), written to and read from requests.jsonl.

### Design notes
- Fail-open is the contract: safe_apply catches filter errors, compress_body catches traversal errors, and compress_text guards (below 500 chars / above 10 MiB untouched; empty or larger output reverts to original; `is_error` results skipped to preserve stack traces).
- Filters are pure deterministic text transforms — the same history compresses to the same bytes every turn, so provider prompt-cache prefixes survive.
- After enabling rtk, re-run `usage calibrate`: a threshold tuned on uncompressed traffic over-triggers pro (`"auto"` self-corrects after its window).

## v0.4.2 - 2026-08-18

New L4 routing layer: what the agent just did decides where the next turn goes. Search-phase turns (Grep/Glob/LS just returned) route to flash; edit-phase turns (Edit/Write/apply_patch just ran) route to pro.

### Added
- `InspectResult.last_tool`: lowercased name of the most recent tool call in the resent history, extracted per protocol (anthropic `tool_use`, openai-chat `tool_calls`, openai-responses `function_call`).
- L4 tool-phase routing in `router.py`, below L3: search-class → `settings.toolRouting.search` (default flash), edit-class → `settings.toolRouting.edit` (default pro), with labels `toolSearch`/`toolEdit`. `toolEdit` is excluded from L3 calibration (pro at any threshold); `toolSearch` stays in — it flips flash/pro with the threshold exactly like `default`.
- `settings.toolRouting` in routing.json: `{"search": "flash", "edit": "pro"}` — destination keys or `null` to disable a rule; block absent = both defaults on. Invalid values die with a clear message.
- `EDIT_TOOLS` name set (edit/write/multiedit/notebook_edit/apply_patch/str_replace/replace_in_file/write_to_file/apply_diff/create_file, case-insensitive); search-class reuses `FILE_SEARCH_TOOLS`.
- Serve banner prints the active mapping (`tool-phase -> search→flash  edit→pro`).
- Tests: last_tool extraction per protocol, L4 decisions and precedence (L3 long-context beats tool-flash; L1 web_search beats tool-edit), rule disabling, config parsing.

### Design notes
- L4 sits below L3 on purpose: sessions above `longContextThreshold` stay pro regardless of the last tool, so flash never sees very long contexts and the long-context crossing stays one-way flash→pro.
- Read-class tools are deliberately not classified: after reads the next turn often writes code, and rising read volume already crosses L3 to pro before that turn.
- Sub-threshold sessions now alternate flash↔pro by phase (search → flash, edit → pro); within the cache TTL this alternation is cheap — monitor it with `usage savings` (alternations / expired pro gaps).

## v0.4.1 - 2026-08-18

awerouter can now upgrade itself and tells you when a new release is out. The serve banner also stops recommending the chat wire that Codex removed.

### Added
- `awerouter self-update [--check]`: upgrades to the latest PyPI release — pipx-managed installs run `pipx upgrade awerouter`, everything else `pip install --upgrade`; `--check` shows versions only.
- `update_check.py`: background PyPI check after every command (at most once a day, cached as `update-check.json` in the config dir; `AWEROUTER_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` disables it). A newer release prints a one-line reminder after the command finishes, throttled to once a day. `serve` keeps the check enabled so long sessions still refresh the cache, and the reminder printing after Ctrl-C is the natural moment to upgrade.
- Serve banner shows an update hint (`update available: x → y  (awerouter self-update)`) from the cached check — no network, no thread, may lag the newest release by a day.
- Tests: `test_update_check.py` covers version comparison, skip rules, cache freshness/remind throttling, the kill switch, the banner hint, and the `self-update` command (`--check`, up-to-date, installer invocation).

### Changed
- Serve banner no longer tells Codex users on an openai-chat profile to set `wire_api = "chat"` — Codex 0.122+ rejects it. It now says to point Codex at an openai-responses profile; openai-responses profiles keep the `wire_api = "responses"` hint. The old-`agent`-field migration message in `config.py` matches.

## v0.4.0 - 2026-08-17

awerouter now detects file-search tools wrapped inside shell commands (Codex `exec_command` / `shell`), and usage commands surface the discounted file-search token counts alongside raw totals.

### Added
- `protocols.py`: `_is_file_search()`, `_is_search_command()`, and `_shell_is_search()` recognize file-search traffic inside shell commands — compound commands split on `;` / `&&` / `||` / newlines, pipeline heads are inspected, env-prefixed and absolute-path binaries are supported, and `git grep` is recognized. Both Codex's single-command `cmd` string and older argv-form `command` arrays are handled. Case-insensitive matching covers opencode's lowercase `grep` / `glob` / `list` names, and `list` joins the direct file-search tool set.
- `usage log --tokens` annotates `tool_results` with the embedded file-search count, e.g. `results=20(search=20)`.
- `usage tokens` and `usage stats` headers now print the active `search discount`, raw `search` token total, and L3 `effective` token total for the filtered window.
- Tests: `test_router.py` covers case-insensitive names, shell-wrapped search binaries, env-prefixed paths, `git grep`, non-search shell commands, multiline commands, and argv-form command arrays.

### Changed
- L3 difficulty scoring now applies `searchResultDiscount` to file-search tokens whether they come from direct file-search tool results or from shell-wrapped search commands, so Codex bulk-search traffic no longer inflates effective context.
- `usage log` window filters (`--profile`, `--since`) read the whole log first, then filter, then take the last `--lines` — matches outside the raw tail window are no longer silently dropped.
- `usage tokens` prints the file-search subset inside the `tool_results` line (`includes 20 search at 30% weight`) so per-type totals stay additive and backward-compatible.

## v0.3.9 - 2026-08-17

`longContextThreshold` can now be set to `"auto"` in `routing.json`. At each `serve` start, awerouter takes the `percentile` of the profile's own L3 effective-token distribution over the trailing `windowDays` as the threshold. With fewer than `minSamples` L3 requests in the window, `fallbackThreshold` applies instead. All four knobs live in `settings.longContextAuto` (all optional).

### Added
- `AutoThresholdConfig` dataclass (`types.py`): `percentile` (default 95), `windowDays` (default 7), `minSamples` (default 50), `fallbackThreshold` (default 8000).
- `auto_threshold()` in `logging.py`: picks the threshold from a profile's own L3 traffic over the configured trailing window, or returns `None` when samples are insufficient.
- `_resolve_auto_threshold()` in `server.py`: materializes `"auto"` once at serve start (before the socket opens), so the value is fixed for the process lifetime. The banner prints what was picked and why.
- `_l3_tokens()` helper + `_base_label()`: `token_distribution` now delegates to `_l3_tokens`, which strips the `→fallback` suffix before the L3 label check — flash→pro fallback entries still calibrate.
- `default-routing.json` ships with a `longContextAuto` block using the defaults.
- `awerouter add` wizard accepts `"auto"` for `longContextThreshold` and persists it as the string `"auto"`.
- `awerouter list` shows `L3>auto` for auto profiles.
- `usage calibrate` ends with the value `"auto"` would pick under the current policy (or a fallback notice when samples are insufficient), independent of the `--since` view.
- Tests: `test_cli.py`, `test_config.py`, `test_logging.py`, `test_server.py` cover the new type, config parsing, wizard output, calibration display, auto threshold logic, and serve-start resolution.

### Changed
- `load_routing()` parses `settings.longContextAuto` (partial fills keep defaults) and marks profiles with `threshold_auto=True` when `longContextThreshold` is the string `"auto"`. Before serve resolves it, the profile reads `fallbackThreshold`.
- `format_routing_display()` serializes `longContextAuto` and prints `"auto"` for auto profiles.
- Removed stale TODO docs (`docs/todo/code-quality.md`, `docs/todo/l3-complexity.md`).

## v0.3.8 - 2026-08-17

### Added
- `settings.searchResultDiscount` (default `0.3`): file-search tool results (Grep/Glob/LS) are now discounted when L3 scores request difficulty. Bulk search hits inflate context cheaply, so they no longer alone push a request to pro.

### Changed
- L3 difficulty scoring now uses `effective_tokens(token_count, file_search_tokens, discount)` instead of raw `token_count`, so flash can carry longer conversations that include file-search results.
- `usage calibrate` now prints the active `searchResultDiscount` so threshold tuning matches the actual scoring rule.

## v0.3.7 - 2026-08-17

### Added
- `awerouter usage tokens [--since] [--profile]`: input-token totals and share by content type (messages, system prompt, tool definitions, tool results, tool-call arguments, thinking). Entries logged before per-type counting are reported separately as not itemized.
- `awerouter usage log --tokens`: per-entry view that swaps the status/latency/model-in columns for the per-type token breakdown (`msg/sys/tools/results/calls/think`).

### Changed
- Token counting now includes system prompt, tool definitions, tool results, tool-call inputs, and thinking blocks across all three protocols. Previously only message prose was counted (and inconsistently across protocols). `longContextThreshold` values need recalibration via `usage calibrate` after upgrading.
- Requests are now logged with a per-type `tokens` breakdown; `token_count` is the sum of the per-type estimates (each with a 1-token floor), so totals may differ from the previous single-pass estimate by a few tokens per request. Routing semantics unchanged.

## v0.3.6 - 2026-08-17

### Changed
- Python 3.9 compatibility fix: added `from __future__ import annotations` to `config.py`, `logging.py`, `server.py`, and `router.py` so PEP 604 union syntax (`int | None`) works at runtime on 3.9.
- Test compatibility: relaxed bare `awerouter usage` help assertion to accept click 8.1's exit 0.

### Added
- Project logo added to README header (`logo/logo.png`).

## v0.3.5 - 2026-08-17

### Changed
- `config show [PROFILE]`: single-profile redacted view (the providers it uses + its routing entry); no argument keeps the full-config view.
- `config path` prints both config file paths (`providers.json`, `routing.json`) instead of the config directory.
- `config edit` opens `providers.json` or `routing.json` — the file is an optional argument (`providers` / `routing`) or an interactive choice — instead of opening the config directory; snapshots the file to `.bak` first.
- `awerouter add` wizard: prints a `providers.json` category overview, and provider selection is a choice list over the category's existing providers (`<new>` adds one) instead of free text with a hint.
- Removed `config init` (use top-level `awerouter init`); error hints updated to match.
- **Version single-sourced** in `awerouter.__version__`: `pyproject.toml` reads it dynamically (`tool.setuptools.dynamic`) and the serve banner/`GET /` import it, so a release bump touches exactly one file instead of three lockstep edits (v0.3.1 had bumped `pyproject.toml`, `__init__.py`, and `server.py` in unison).
- **`usage` window options moved onto the subcommands**: `--since` and `--profile` are now options of `log`, `stats`, `calibrate`, and `savings` (`awerouter usage stats --since today`), no longer sitting between `usage` and the subcommand. `clean` takes no window options — it deletes the whole log either way.

### Added
- **Predictable port allocation**: optional `port` field in a `routing.json` profile pins its listen port; precedence `--port` flag > profile `port` > 20128 default. An explicitly chosen port that is already in use now fails loudly (clients hardcode it) instead of silently drifting to a random port. Without a configured port, serve scans upward from 20128 for the first free port — the first instance gets 20128, the next 20129, in start order — replacing the old random-port fallback, so parallel instances land on predictable sequential ports. `awerouter list` and `config show` display the port, and the serve banner notes when it came from `routing.json`.
- `awerouter restore [providers|routing]`: restore a config file from its `.bak` backup. Backups are single-slot (aweswitch convention) and written by `config edit` and the `add` wizard before every write.
- `usage clean`: deletes saved request logs after a confirmation prompt — moved off `usage stats --clean` so `stats` stays read-only.
- Request log records `protocol` and `agent` per request. Protocol is the wire protocol served; agent is the calling client normalized from its `User-Agent` header (`claude-cli/...` → `claude-code`, `codex_cli_rs/...` → `codex`, `opencode/...` → `opencode`; unknown clients keep their first UA token) — awerouter only sees the wire request, so the UA is the only place caller identity exists. `usage log` shows both columns; `usage stats` labels each profile with its protocol and adds a `by_agent` breakdown. Legacy entries without the fields keep parsing (shown as `-` / `(unknown)`).

## v0.3.1 - 2026-08-16

### Changed
- **CLI cleanup**: removed `awerouter show` (use `awerouter config show` instead) and removed the bare `awerouter usage` default view (use `awerouter usage stats` explicitly).

## v0.3.0 - 2026-08-16

### Added
- AI agent setup docs (`README.ai.md`) with step-by-step install, config, and verification guide.
- `awerouter` skill docs for AI agent management of routing via natural language.
- Environment variable setup guide for `${ENV_VAR}` auth references across platforms.
- aweswitch integration section: profile-based launching with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` pointing at the awerouter daemon.
- `webSearchModel` setting: L1 web_search traffic now routes to `settings.webSearchModel` (default `pro`) instead of hardcoded pro.
- README badge reorganized; Ko-fi badge moved to header.

## v0.2.9 - 2026-08-16

### Breaking
- **CLI restructure**: `log`, `stats`, `savings`, and `calibrate` merge into one `usage` group — `awerouter usage [stats|tail|savings|calibrate]`. Bare `awerouter usage` shows the stats summary; window options (`--since`, `--profile`) sit between `usage` and the subcommand.

### Added
- **Unversioned endpoint aliases**: `/chat/completions`, `/responses`, and `/models` are served alongside the `/v1/...` forms, so OpenAI-style clients work whether their base_url includes `/v1` or not. Fixes the `404: Not Found` hit by clients configured with a bare `http://127.0.0.1:20128` base (Anthropic clients append `/v1/messages` themselves; OpenAI clients append the bare path). The serve banner now suggests the standard `/v1` form for openai protocols.
- Typo-friendly command resolution at every level (top level, `usage`, `config`): an unknown subcommand close to a real one gets a did-you-mean suggestion (`awerouter server x` → "did you mean 'serve'?"), and far-off tokens with stray arguments get a `-h` pointer instead of the cryptic "Got unexpected extra argument". Valid bare-profile launches (`awerouter <profile> [--port/--host]`) are unaffected.
- `usage stats` rework: `~total_tokens` (estimated input message tokens) replaces the meaningless `total_bytes`; new `by_model` breakdown, error and fallback counts, and percentages on all breakdowns.
- Latency percentiles per destination **and** per provider/model, in two flavors: first-byte (`ms`) and total request duration (`duration_ms`, now logged per request; legacy entries without it are excluded from totals).
- Window filters `--since today|yesterday|Nd|YYYY-MM-DD` and `--profile NAME` on every `usage` view (entries with unparseable timestamps are excluded while filtering), plus a coverage note when the requested window predates the oldest retained log entry.
- `usage stats --clean` deletes the saved request log and its rotated backup after a confirmation prompt.
- `usage savings`: token accounting vs a pro-only baseline — message-input tokens per tier (with per-request averages), pro input tokens offloaded to flash, fallback count, and the offload share. Tokens only by design; no prices in config (multiply by your providers' input prices yourself).
- `usage savings` cache sensitivity: brackets the offload between "all cache reads" (~0.1x) and "all full price" (1x) under Anthropic-style cache economics (write ~1.25x, TTL 5 min), and reports switch cadence vs the TTL (flash<->pro alternations, consecutive-pro gaps, expired gaps) so users can judge how much a cache-warm pro-only baseline would have discounted the naive number.
- `usage savings` ends with ready-to-fill money formulas using the measured token counts (`upper` and `cache-aware`, prices per 1M tokens) — users substitute their providers' input prices and read off the saved amount.

## v0.2.5 - 2026-08-16

Protocol-based provider grouping with same-protocol passthrough for all three major wire protocols.

### Breaking
- **Config schema**: `providers.json` outer keys are now protocol ids (`anthropic` / `openai-chat` / `openai-responses`) instead of agent names; `routing.json` profiles declare `protocol` instead of `agent`. Old configs fail at load with rename hints (`claude` → `anthropic`, `codex` → `openai-chat` / `openai-responses`).
- **base_url semantics** follow each native client's convention: anthropic = `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` style (no `/v1`, awerouter appends `/v1/messages`); openai = `OPENAI_BASE_URL` style (includes the version segment, awerouter appends `/chat/completions` or `/responses`). Copy the URL verbatim from your client config — the same provider can use different paths per protocol (e.g. GLM: `.../api/coding/paas/v4` for chat, `.../api/v1` for responses).

### Added
- **OpenAI protocol support, same-protocol passthrough** (no translation): `POST /v1/chat/completions` and `POST /v1/responses` are served alongside `/v1/messages`. The response path stays opaque byte streaming; only request-side signal extraction is per protocol.
- Per-protocol signal extraction (`protocols.py`): text/image/web_search detection for all three request shapes, including responses-API `input` items (reasoning/function-call items carry no text and are skipped) and builtin `{type: "web_search"}` tools.
- All endpoints are always mounted; hitting one that doesn't match the profile's protocol returns a clear JSON 400 instead of a bare 404.
- Serve banner prints per-protocol client hints: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` + tier env for anthropic, `OPENAI_BASE_URL` + Codex `wire_api` for the openai protocols.

### Notes
- OpenAI clients are single-model (no tier env story like Claude Code), so L2 tier matching effectively never fires for them — openai traffic routes by L1 + L3 with a flash default. Fallback, logging, stats, and calibrate are protocol-agnostic.

## v0.2.0 - 2026-08-16

Per-profile observability, project support, and release automation.

### Added
- `stats` groups by routing profile and estimates **pro input offloaded to flash**: message tokens of flash-served requests a pro-only setup would have billed at pro's input price (system prompt and tools excluded, so conservative).
- Request log records the serving profile (`profile` field); entries logged before this feature group under `(unknown)`.
- Project support: Ko-fi badge and Support section in both READMEs, `FUNDING.yml` for the GitHub sponsor button, WeChat Pay QR under `assets/images/`.
- CI workflow: test matrix (Ubuntu/macOS/Windows × Python 3.9/3.13) plus build/twine-check package job on `main` and `dev`.
- Release automation: pushing a `v*` tag verifies tag↔version match, runs tests, builds, extracts the changelog entry into the GitHub Release, and publishes to PyPI (`PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret).
- PyPI package metadata: readme, author, keywords, classifiers; `MANIFEST.in` ships READMEs and assets in the sdist.
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Fixed
- `__version__` in `awerouter/__init__.py` had drifted from `pyproject.toml`; both now track the release version.

## v0.1.5 - 2026-08-16

Multi-provider profile-based routing, interactive onboarding, and code-quality hardening.

### Highlights
- **Agent-grouped providers**: `providers.json` now groups providers by agent (`claude` / `codex` / `opencode`), and each routing profile declares its `agent`, making it possible to route different agent types through the same daemon.
- **Configurable web_search routing**: L1 `web_search` destination is no longer hard-coded to `pro`; it now follows `settings.webSearchModel`, so operators can redirect it independently.
- **Interactive profile wizard**: `awerouter add` walks users through profile creation step by step, auto-creating any new providers with `${VAR}` auth references and keeping `providers.json` / `routing.json` references consistent.
- **Profile management commands**: `awerouter list` (one-line overview), `awerouter show [PROFILE]` (redacted single-profile or full-config view), and `awerouter <PROFILE>` shorthand for `serve <PROFILE>`.

### Fixed / Hardened
- `_proxy_request` no longer mutates the request body in place (shallow copy per upstream attempt).
- `detect_auth_header` matches the URL netloc instead of a substring — `https://evil.com/anthropic.com` no longer misdetected as Anthropic.
- `config show` now cross-validates `routing.json` destinations against `providers.json`, so bad references fail immediately instead of on first request.
- Network-level upstream failures now append a status-502 entry to the request log instead of leaving no trace.

### Added
- `serve` warns at startup when shell proxy vars are set without loopback exempted in `no_proxy` — the cause of empty-body 502s from proxied clients.
- `awerouter init` — top-level alias for `config init`.
- `awerouter add` — interactive wizard that builds a routing profile step by step, creating any new providers (auth stored as `${VAR}` refs) and keeping the two-file references consistent.
- `awerouter list` — one-line-per-profile overview (name, agent, flash, pro, threshold).
- `awerouter show [PROFILE]` — single-profile redacted view (providers it uses + routing entry); without an argument it shows the whole config.
- `awerouter <PROFILE>` — bare profile name as shorthand for `serve <PROFILE>` (defined commands always win over profile names).
- `serve` startup banner now prints the ready-to-copy `export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=...` line and the tier env vars for the aweswitch profile.
- `config edit` auto-initializes the default config when missing instead of erroring.
- Per-request `request_id` (reuses client `x-request-id` when present, otherwise generated) written to the request log and shown by `awerouter log`.
- Log rotation: the request log rotates to `requests.jsonl.1` when it exceeds `AWEROUTER_LOG_MAX_BYTES` (default 50 MB); `awerouter log` reads from the end of the file instead of loading it whole.
- `calibrate` output now clarifies the distribution counts message tokens only (system prompt and tools excluded).

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-13

Initial release of awerouter — a local daemon that routes Claude Code requests to different providers/models based on structural request signals, on a single port.

### Features
- **Three-layer first-match-wins router**: L1 capability guard (`web_search` tool → pro), L2 tier-label match (background/think model ids), L3 difficulty score (long context / image → pro, default → flash).
- **Opaque SSE proxy**: streams Anthropic `/v1/messages` responses byte-for-byte without parsing or buffering; logs are written even on client disconnect.
- **Two-file config**: `providers.json` (secrets, `${VAR}` expansion, redacted in `config show`) and `routing.json` (strategy, safe to commit).
- **count_tokens passthrough** and `GET /v1/models` advertising the tier model ids.
- **Pre-stream flash → pro fallback** on transient upstream errors (429/408/5xx), before any byte is sent.
- **Structured append-only request log** (JSONL) with `log`, `stats`, and `calibrate` commands; `calibrate` shows L3 token distribution to tune `longContextThreshold`.
- **aweswitch integration** via a single profile pointing `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at awerouter.
